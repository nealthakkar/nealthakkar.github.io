		<p>Homework 1
Instructions: You will receive a score of a 1, 2 , 3 for a lackluster attempt, decent attempt, perfect attempt 
respectively. Show all work… do not just give me an answer. Homeworks that just 
have an answer will receive a 0 Take your time with this I would reserve about 3 hours of time to finish 
the work. The first 3 are standard the last 3 are “fun”.
1. Suppose Arianna Grande’s preferences are represented by U(x,y)=x2y
3
. Price of good x is 5 and 
price of good y is 10. Addtionally Ari starts out with 30 dollars in this period.
a. Ari has a utility function with what degree of homogeneity?
b. Calculate Ari’s optimal x and y such that she maximizes her utility and stays within her 
budget
c. Graph Ari’s efficiency condition and budget line. Remember to label axes as well as 
intercepts.
2. Suppose John Cena’s preferences are represented by U(x,y)=min{2x,3y}. Price of good x is 3 
and price of good y is 4. John Cena starts out with 20 dollars in this period.
a. John has a utility function with what degree of homogeneity?
b. Graph John’s indifference curve for a utility equal to 6
c. Calculate John’s optimal x and y such that she maximizes her utility and stays within her 
budget
d. Graph John’s efficiency condition and budget line. Remember to label axes as well as 
intercepts.
3. Kanye West’s preferences are represented by U(x,y)= αx+βy. Price of good x is 5 and Price of 
good y is 8. Kanye has an income of 40 dollars.
a. For what values of α and β does Kanye consume only good x. What about the values 
such that Kanye consumes only good y
b. Assume α and β are 2 and 4 respectively. Find Kanye’s optimal consumption bundle.
4. Suppose Josh’s preferences are described by U(x,y)=max{min(3x,y) , min(x,3y)}. Derive Josh’s 
demands for good x and y respectively taking into account all possible prices for good x and good 
y.
5. Suppose that Taylor Swift likes to consume food and likes to have leisure time. Her preferences 
are represented by U(F,L)=F1/2L
1/2 where F is food and L is leisure. However in order for her to
have money she needs to work. If she is not working she is having leisure time. She earns 12 
dollars an hour. The price of food is 2 dollars. Find T-Swizzle’s optimal choice for leisure and 
consumption of food in a given day.
6. Imagine you procrastinated and did not study for Professor Ng’s final. It is 10 hours before the 
final examination. You can allocate your time to either study or party and post the pictures on 
snapchat via chapmanyak. Your grade is represented by G=2.5S+10P1/2 where S is how much 
you study and P is how much you party. How much time do you study and how much time do 
you party? Additionally what grade you receive for my… I mean Professor Ng’s final.</p>
